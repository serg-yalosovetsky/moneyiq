# ADR Log

## ADR-001: Native Android + Compose

The app is implemented as a native Android app using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Continue feature work in Compose unless a platform API requires XML or manifest-level configuration.

## ADR-002: Local-First Persistence

Room is the source of truth for accounts, categories, and transactions. Data access should go through DAOs and repositories rather than ad hoc storage.

## ADR-003: Repositories Own Balance Side Effects

`TransactionRepository` applies and rolls back balance changes when transactions are added, deleted, or updated. UI code must not independently adjust account balances.

## ADR-004: Categories Are Hierarchical

Categories support `parentId`; root categories drive the broad category view and children may be shown or aggregated depending on the screen state.

## ADR-005: 1Money-Like UX Is A Product Constraint

Several layouts intentionally mimic 1Money behavior, especially categories, month navigation, and bottom tabs. Preserve visual similarity when changing these surfaces.

## ADR-006: Context Docs Are Not Runtime Code

`.context` is documentation only. Do not import it, bundle it, or make runtime behavior depend on it.

## ADR-007: Shared Month State Via Repository

`SelectedMonthRepository` is the single source of truth for the selected period. All feature screens observe its `StateFlow<AppMonth>`. Do not give individual screens their own month state. Month navigation (prev/next/jump) must go through this repository.

## ADR-008: CategoryStyleUtil For Icon/Color Suggestion

`util/CategoryStyleUtil.kt` owns the keyword→icon/color mapping. When adding new categories programmatically (seeder, import), always use `suggestCategoryStyle(name, type)` if the icon key is unknown or invalid. Do not hard-code icon key strings outside this utility and `CategoryRepository.seedDefaults()`.

## ADR-009: Settings Are Overlaid, Not Navigated

`SettingsScreen` and `EditCategoriesScreen` are rendered as full-screen Compose overlays inside `MainScreen`, not as separate navigation destinations. This keeps the `NavGraph` minimal (only `Main` and `AddTx` routes). Do not add routes for settings or category editing.
